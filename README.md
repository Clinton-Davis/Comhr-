## UX

As it is a Course project, there is no UX mandate but more a design aspect to it. I went for a colour full light-hearted look for the app. 
<a name="scope"></a>
## Scope
The idea is to get people to chat with each other

## Structure.


#### **_Main Page_**
 - **-Navigation Bar-**
   - I used the Irish word for a chat in a friendly bold font.<br>
  
#### **_About Page_**  
   - Just a little note from me explaining what the app is about

## Surface
  -  The Navigation Bar at the top has a full-colour collage of things all commutation related.
     The background image of the two ladies having a chat is what the app is all about. The Cartoon drawing is friendly and      funny.
     I went for a big font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), called *"Righteous"* as the primary font. I chose      this font because of its clean and clear look. The secondary font is *"Indie Flower"*. This one is lite handwriting and      has a fun feel to it.

## Features

- **Cookies**
-  The app makes use of the cookies to keep the user name and message in memory until the browser closes.

- **User Name**
- When you enter your username, you get redirected to your message page. Where you can start to write messages. 
  The app makes a list of the messages sent and store them in the username message list. and be printed on the screen 
- **Time Stamp**
- When the user writes a message, the app prints a time stamp on the message and prints it with the message.
- **Auto Refresh**
- Comhrá uses Javascript to refresh every 5 seconds to the chat is always up to date, It waits for 7 seconds once a key is pressed so the user can finish writing the message without having to rush or get cut off my the interval timer.
